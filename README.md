Project 1: Automatic Number Plate Recognition with Easy OCR and OpenCV.
The implementation of ANPR is divided into several small steps

Install and Import Dependencies

Reading an Image

Apply Filter and Find Edges For Localization

Find the Contours and Apply Mask

Creating a Blank Mask:

Drawing the Contours

Use Easy OCR to Read Text

Render Results: Overlay Results on the Original Image
Project 2: Brain Tumor Detection using Ultralytics YOLO11
This notebook serves as an initial step for training the YOLO11 model.

Applications: The application of brain tumor detection using computer vision enables early diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of tumor progression. By analyzing medical imaging data like MRI or CT scans, computer vision systems assist in accurately identifying brain tumors, aiding in timely medical intervention and personalized treatment strategies.Project 1: Automatic Number Plate Recognition with Easy OCR and OpenCV.
